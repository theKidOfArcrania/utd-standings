# UTD Standings

This simple python script computes a person's student status (Freshman,
Sophomore, Junior, or Senior, which is determined by number of completed credit
hours) based on the UTD's student directory.

## Usage

First make sure that all requirements are installed:
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Then run the command:
```
python standings.py
```

After starting the python script, just type in a list of student names delimited
by spaces.
